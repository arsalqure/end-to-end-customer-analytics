# Blog Post — Instacart Flagship Project

## Problem
Instacart needs to reduce churn and increase repeat purchase frequency. By identifying high-value customers and modeling purchase propensity we can prioritize marketing spend and measure lift.

## Approach
1. Data ingestion via Kaggle dataset
2. Data cleaning & feature engineering (RFM, CLV proxies)
3. Cohort analysis and visualization
4. Predictive modeling for 30-day activity
5. A/B test simulation to estimate impact

## Insights (run notebooks for exact numbers)
- High-value customers represent a disproportionate share of revenue
- A targeted email campaign to 'at-risk' but high-CLV users shows strong ROI in simulation

## Business Impact
Targeting the top 5-10% of at-risk customers with a tailored campaign yields higher incremental revenue per marketing rupee than broad promotions.

## Share
Publish visuals and dashboards to Tableau Public / Power BI and link in repo.
